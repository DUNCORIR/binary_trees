0x1D. C - Binary Trees
Description
This project focuses on implementing and understanding binary trees in C. It covers the fundamentals of tree data structures, different traversal methods, and the properties of various types of binary trees.

Learning Objectives
By the end of this project, you will be able to:

Define a binary tree and its components.
Differentiate between a binary tree and a binary search tree (BST).
Understand the advantages of binary trees over linked lists in terms of time complexity.
Calculate the depth, height, and size of a binary tree.
Implement various tree traversal methods (in-order, pre-order, post-order, level-order).
Explain the properties of complete, full, perfect, and balanced binary trees.
Requirements
All code will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc with the following options:
bash
Copy code
gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89
Code must follow the Betty style.
No global variables are allowed.
No more than 5 functions per file.
A header file binary_trees.h will contain all function prototypes.
Files
File Name	Description
binary_trees.h	Header file containing all function prototypes and structures.
*.c	C files implementing various binary tree operations.
README.md	Project documentation.
Compilation
To compile the project, use the following command:

bash
Copy code
gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89 *.c -o binary_trees
